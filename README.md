This is probably the first "web app" I ever made, on school computers in year 5.

It sat on my networked user drive for about a year, at which point I found out about this whole "git" thing and uploaded
it to my GitHub account. Unfortunately, in the 10 years since, I've forgotten the password to that account.

I've made this for mainly for nostalgia's sake, I was super proud of it when it was made.
