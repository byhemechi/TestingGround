This is probably the first "web app" I ever made, on school computers in year 5.

It sat on my networked user drive for about a year, at which point I found out about this whole "git" thing and uploaded
it to my GitHub account. Unfortunately, in the 10 years since, I've forgotten the password to that account.

I've made this fork so I can host it mainly for nostalgia's sake, I was super proud of it when it was made.
I've fixed some terrible CSS and made it load this README by default

It's hosted at <https://testingground.byhe.me>

You can see the original version circa 2014 [here](https://github.com/thediex09/TestingGround)

Below is the old README, written by me, George, age 11

The "Hidden stuff" was the silly zoom-in animation on the "logo" in the navbar. At the time CSS animations were unstable and I had written only the webkit vendor-prefixed properties. This fork has been updated so that firefox users can see this space-age technology
